# Street Flood Prediction Modelling

**Course**: CE784A - Machine Learning and Data Analytics for Civil Engineering Applications  
**Instructor**: Prof. Pranamesh Chakraborty

## Project Overview

This project uses a Random Forest regression model to predict street-level flooding in urban areas. Key topographic and environmental features are used to forecast hourly water depth during storm events, supporting real-time flood management.

**Features**:
- **Topographic**: Elevation, Depth to Water (DTW), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)
- **Environmental**: Rainfall metrics (cumulative and temporal)

Model accuracy: **Training R² = 0.9977**, **Testing R² = 0.9463**.
