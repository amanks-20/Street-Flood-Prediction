# Street Flood Prediction Modelling

**Course**: CE784A - Machine Learning and Data Analytics for Civil Engineering Applications  
**Instructor**: Prof. Pranamesh Chakraborty  
**Semester**: 2024-25 (I)  
**Group**: Fluvial Prognosticators

## Project Overview

This project uses a Random Forest regression model to predict street-level flooding in urban areas. Key topographic and environmental features are used to forecast hourly water depth during storm events, supporting real-time flood management.

**Features**:
- **Topographic**: Elevation, Depth to Water (DTW), Topographic Wetness Index (TWI)
- **Environmental**: Rainfall metrics (cumulative and temporal)

Model accuracy: **Training R² = 0.9977**, **Testing R² = 0.9463**.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amanks-20/Street-Flood-Prediction.git
   cd Street-Flood-Prediction

2.	Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt


**Usage**

	1.	Run the Notebook:
Open main.ipynb to view data processing, model training, and evaluation.
	2.	Results:
	•	Training R²: 0.9977
	•	Testing R²: 0.9463

**Contribution**

Developed by Aman Kumar Singh, Om Jee, and Khushbu for the CE784A course.
